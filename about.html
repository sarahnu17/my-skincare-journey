                    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Sarah Nuno, and I have oily-combination skin. I started my skincare journey shortly after graduating from college. Before that, I never really paid much attention to my skin. I played tennis most of my life, so I was out in the sun for a large portion of my life. I would wear sunscreen, but I would buy the cheapest options. I would also rarely ever reapply sunscreen after the recommended reapplication time.</p>
                    <p>Surprisingly, I had pretty decent skin growing up with occasional breakouts. Back then, I washed my face with regular hand soap or rinsed my face off with water. I believe frequently playing and exercising really helped my skin. One of my main focuses now is preventing future damage to my skin.</p>
                    <p>Since getting to know my skin better, I found that my skin is sensitive and soaks up hydrating products. A few of the modifications I made were using a gentle cleanser and incorporating hydrating toners into my routine. </p>
                    <p>I created this website as a small side project to post my experience using skin and hair products.</p>
